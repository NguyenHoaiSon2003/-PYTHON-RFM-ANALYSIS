# Retail company - RFM Analysis (PYTHON)
**I. CONTENT**

RFM (Recency – Frequency – Monetary): is a part of Marketing Analysis and is used to analyze customer value, thereby helping businesses analyze each group of customers they have, from which they can have special marketing or care campaigns. Use the provided data set

**II. CONTEXT**

SuperStore is a global retail company. So the company has a lot of customers.
On the occasion of Christmas and New Year, the Marketing department wants to run marketing campaigns to thank customers who have supported the company over the past time. As well as exploit customers with the potential to become loyal customers.

However, the Marketing department has not yet been able to segment each customer this year because the data set is too large to be processed manually like previous years, so we asked the Data Analysis Department to support the implementation of a segmentation problem for each customer to implement each marketing program suitable for each customer group.

The Marketing Director also proposed the use of the RFM model, but in the past when the company was small, the team could calculate and classify by themselves using Excel. Currently, the amount of data is too large, so we want the Data Department to build a Segmentation evaluation implementation flow through Python programming.
